# Network Monitor

## One Paragraph of project description:
The Network Monitor project is a software tool designed to monitor network traffic, analyze data packets, detect anomalies, and provide insights into network performance. It offers real-time visualization of network activity and generates reports to help administrators troubleshoot issues and optimize network efficiency.

## Getting Started:
These instructions will guide you to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Wireshark (for packet capturing)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

### Installing:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/network-monitor.git
```
2. Install required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure Wireshark is installed and configured for packet capturing.

## Running the tests:
To run automated tests for this system, execute the following command:

```
python run_tests.py
```

```

### Break down into end to end tests:
The automated tests validate various functionalities of the network monitoring tool, including packet capturing, data analysis, and report generation.

### And coding style tests:
Coding style tests ensure adherence to PEP 8 standards and maintain code readability.

## Deployment:
Additional notes on deploying the Network Monitor on a live system will be provided soon.

## Built With:
- Python - Programming language used for development
- Wireshark - Packet capturing tool
- Matplotlib - Data visualization library
